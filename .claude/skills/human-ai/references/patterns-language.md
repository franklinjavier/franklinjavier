### 1. AI Vocabulary (The Slop Dictionary)

**Tier 1 - Zero Tolerance (cut on sight):**

| Word/Phrase | Why it's a tell | Human alternative |
|---|---|---|
| delve | No one says this in conversation | explore, dig into, look at |
| tapestry | Always used as "rich tapestry of..." | (cut entirely - always filler) |
| landscape (figurative) | "The AI landscape" | the AI space, AI right now |
| testament to | "It's a testament to..." | shows that, proves |
| serves as a reminder | Always preamble to nothing | (cut - just state the thing) |
| it's worth noting | Meta-commentary, not content | (cut - the note IS the content) |
| it bears mentioning | Same as above | (cut) |
| the ever-evolving landscape | Double slop | (cut entirely) |
| navigate (complexities) | "Navigate the challenges of" | deal with, handle, figure out |
| spearhead | "Spearheading the initiative" | lead, run, start |
| multifaceted | "This multifaceted problem" | complex, messy, complicated |
| pivotal | "A pivotal moment" | important, key, big |
| paramount | "Of paramount importance" | essential, critical |
| underscores | "This underscores the need" | shows, highlights |
| underpin | "Principles that underpin" | behind, supporting |
| in the realm of | "In the realm of AI" | in AI |
| shed light on | "Shedding light on this issue" | explain, clarify, show |
| this highlights | Meta-commentary | (cut - the highlight IS the sentence) |

**Tier 2 - High Suspicion (replace when clustered, OK once per 1000 words):**

`crucial, vital, comprehensive, robust, leverage, foster, facilitate, embark, harnessing, utilize, endeavor, moreover, furthermore, additionally, subsequently, nonetheless, overarching, intricate, nuanced, holistic, synergy, paradigm, catalyst, orchestrate, seamless, ecosystem (abstract), journey (figurative), unlock (figurative), empower, elevate`

**Tier 3 - Context-Dependent (flag if >2 per 500 words):**

`significant, enhance, innovative, dynamic, diverse, inclusive, sustainable, transformative, streamline, optimize, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, game-changer, disruptive, scalable, impactful, actionable, meaningful, compelling, groundbreaking`

**Detection rule:**
- 1 Tier-1 word = flag the sentence
- 3+ Tier-2 words in one paragraph = flag the paragraph
- 5+ Tier-3 words in one page = flag the text
- Any combination of 2+ Tier-1 words in 500 words = near-certain AI

### 2. Copula Avoidance

**Trigger patterns:** constitutes, represents, serves as, functions as, operates as, positions itself as, stands as, emerges as, figures as

**Problem:** AI avoids "is" and "has" as if they were forbidden words. Replaces them with elaborate constructions no human would use in natural writing.

**Before (AI):**
> Stripe constitutes the leading payments infrastructure for the internet. The platform serves as a comprehensive solution for businesses and positions itself as the de facto standard for online transactions.

**After (human):**
> Stripe is the biggest payments company online. Their API is what most startups use to take money.

**Rule:** If "is" or "has" would work, use it. Save elaborate verbs for when you need precise meaning, not sophistication theater.

### 3. Negative Parallelisms

**Trigger patterns:** not merely X, but Y; it's not just about X, it's about Y; more than X, it's Y; goes far beyond X; transcends the simple X; not simply X, it's fundamentally Y

**Problem:** Formulaic construction that artificially inflates importance. Creates a false dichotomy where the writer pretends to reject something then embraces something bigger - but both parts say the same thing.

**Before (AI):**
> Product management is not merely about writing user stories. It goes far beyond simply shipping features - it's fundamentally about solving real problems. The PM transcends the role of ticket writer; they are, above all, a translator between business and technology.

**After (human):**
> Good PMs solve problems. Bad PMs write tickets. The difference isn't philosophical - it's practical. Look at someone's backlog and you'll know in 5 minutes.

---

### 4. Tricolon Abuse (Rule of Three)

**Trigger patterns:** clarity, concision, and coherence; innovation, technology, and transformation; plan, execute, and measure; any rhythmic triad with "and" before the third item; three adjectives in sequence; three abstract nouns grouped

**Problem:** AI groups ideas in threes because tricolon is rhetorically satisfying - but when it appears in every paragraph, it becomes a tic. Human text groups in 2, in 4, in 1. Rarely in 3 repeatedly.

**Before (AI):**
> The platform delivers speed, reliability, and scalability. Teams need clarity, collaboration, and consistency. Our approach combines innovation, expertise, and dedication.

**After (human):**
> It's fast. Reliable enough that we stopped worrying about downtime. And it scales - we went from 10k to 400k requests/day without changing anything.

**Detection rule:** If a text has 3+ tricolons per page, it's almost certainly AI-generated. Humans occasionally use rule-of-three for rhetorical effect. AI uses it as a structural crutch.

### 5. Weasel Qualifiers

**Trigger patterns:** it could be argued that, one might suggest, there are those who believe, it has been said that, some would argue, many experts believe, it is generally accepted

**Problem:** AI uses qualifiers to avoid committing to claims. The result reads like a Wikipedia article written by someone afraid of being corrected. Humans either commit to a claim or cite a specific source.

**Before (AI):**
> It could be argued that large language models represent a significant advancement. Many experts believe this technology has the potential to transform various industries, though some would argue the risks are considerable.

**After (human):**
> LLMs are a big deal. They'll change how most knowledge work gets done - I genuinely believe that. But Hinton is right that we don't understand alignment well enough to be comfortable.

### 6. Nominalization Disease

**Trigger patterns:** the implementation of, the utilization of, the facilitation of, the optimization of, the enhancement of, the establishment of, provides a demonstration of, performs an analysis of

**Problem:** AI converts verbs into nouns, making sentences longer, vaguer, and harder to parse. "We analyzed" becomes "we performed an analysis of". This is the passive-aggressive cousin of passive voice.

**Before (AI):**
> The implementation of the new system resulted in the enhancement of performance metrics and the facilitation of improved collaboration across teams.

**After (human):**
> We implemented the new system. Performance improved. Teams started collaborating more.

**Rule:** If a noun ending in -tion/-ment/-ance has a simpler verb form, use the verb.



---

### 7. Ornamental -ly Adverb Inflation

**Trigger patterns:** markedly, remarkably, strikingly, dramatically, profoundly, critically, fundamentally, notably (mid-sentence), significantly (without statistical test), increasingly, rapidly (figurative), uniquely, vastly, deeply, exceptionally, substantially (without quantitative backing)

**Problem:** AI decorates sentences with intensifier adverbs that add emphasis but no information. These words gesture at magnitude without actually quantifying anything. Human writing uses -ly adverbs functionally - to convey specific magnitude, frequency, direction, or calibration.

**Before (AI):**
> Users have reported markedly improved performance and remarkably consistent results. The system is critically important for dramatically reducing latency and fundamentally changing how teams work.

**After (human):**
> Users reported 40% faster load times. Latency dropped from 200ms to 50ms. Teams actually use the dashboard now - they didn't before.

**Functional adverbs to KEEP (these carry information):**
- `approximately, slightly, modestly, consistently, almost, only, largely, generally, relatively`
- `statistically significantly` (when an actual test result is being reported)
- `substantially` (when it refers to a real, stated effect-size difference)

**Decision rule:** Delete the adverb mentally and ask whether any information was lost. If nothing was lost, it was ornamental - delete it OR replace the emphasis with the concrete number or comparison it was gesturing at. If it conveyed magnitude, frequency, direction, or calibration, it is functional - keep it.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Never remove an adverb without restructuring the sentence.**
>
> Experimental validation (Matsui 2025, using desklib + Binoculars detectors) showed that **removing an ornamental adverb WITHOUT restructuring the sentence INCREASES AI-detection scores** (+0.72 logit worse). The shorter, more uniform sentence fits the AI cadence better.
>
> **Wrong approach:** "Performance was markedly improved" → "Performance was improved"
>
> **Right approach:** "Performance was markedly improved" → "Load times dropped by 40%. The dashboard actually responds now."
>
> When you remove an ornamental adverb, ALWAYS restructure: split the sentence, merge with the next sentence, reposition clauses, or add concrete data. Never just delete.

### 8. Synonym Cycling (Elegant Variation)

**Trigger patterns:** Using different words for the same entity across sentences: "the platform... the solution... the system... the tool"; "users... customers... clients... patrons"; "the author... the writer... the creator... the wordsmith"

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code that drives it to cycle through synonyms even when referring to the exact same thing. In technical or professional writing, **the same construct should be called by the same name throughout** - this is a feature of good writing, not a defect. Synonym cycling signals AI and confuses readers about whether different entities are being discussed.

**Before (AI):**
> The platform allows users to create workflows. The solution then executes these automations. Customers have reported that the system saves them hours. Clients particularly appreciate that the tool integrates with existing software.

**After (human):**
> The platform lets users create workflows and executes them automatically. Users report saving hours per week. They particularly like the integrations.

**Rule:** Pick one term for each concept and use it consistently. "Users" throughout, not "users... customers... clients". "The platform" throughout, not "platform... solution... system... tool".

**Exception:** Pronouns ("it", "they", "this") are natural variation. Florid synonyms ("the visionary creator", "the paradigm-shifting innovation") are not.
