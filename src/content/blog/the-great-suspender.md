Many people have been complaining about Google Chrome's memory consumption.
Depending on usage, the software can consume up to 1GB. The situation gets even worse when using many extensions.

I have the habit of opening several tabs when I'm studying,
and throughout the day I analyze and close them. Even though my machine's configuration is good,
there comes a time when it gets quite slow.

To try to alleviate this situation, [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg)
is an extension that suspends the process of tabs that are inactive for X time.
That is, if I configured the time to 30 minutes, tabs that remain inactive for that time are suspended. Simple as that!

Pinned tabs or those defined in a whitelist don't fall under the above condition, preventing pages
from being suspended.

Another cool feature is the history of suspended pages. Each entry includes a timestamp of when
the suspension occurred. If you want, you can suspend again or reload all pages from a previous day.

Have you found any extension that made your life easier? Comment.
