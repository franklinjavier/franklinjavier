## About Me

I'm a self-taught, highly experienced front-end developer with 16+ years of experience. I have a proven track record of delivering high-performance, user-friendly applications.

As a Principal Engineer, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and leadership skills. My primary focus has been on front-end architecture, specifically web and mobile development. I have a deep understanding of modern front-end technologies and frameworks, including React/Node.js and its ecosystem.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am highly skilled in performance optimization, monitoring, and observability. I have a proven track record of identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.

Furthermore, I am an expert in design systems and accessibility, which I consider crucial aspects of good front-end development. My goal is to build accessible, user-friendly, and consistent applications that meet the needs of all users, regardless of their abilities.

I am also an active member of the front-end guild, with experience in interviews and onboarding processes, mentoring and pair programming, M&A processes, and building POCs. Additionally, I am a speaker at tech talks and meetups, sharing my experience and knowledge with the community.
